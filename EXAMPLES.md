## Tips for Better Results

1. **Be specific about locations**: "Old Montreal" is better than "old town"
2. **Mention your preferences**: "I prefer fewer transfers" or "shortest route"
3. **Include time constraints**: "before 5pm" or "in the morning"
4. **Ask about weather first**: The bot will give better transport recommendations
5. **Use your location**: Allow browser location for "from here" type queries

## French Examples

Le bot comprend aussi le français:

- "Comment me rendre au Vieux-Montréal?"
- "Quelle est la météo?"
- "Meilleur trajet en vélo vers le Plateau"
- "Je dois être à Place-des-Arts à 19h"
- "Itinéraire en métro vers l'université McGill"

- "Partir de Verdun vers le centre-ville"
- "Directions pour le Parc du Mont-Royal"

## Troubleshooting Prompts

If you're not getting good results:

1. **Too vague**: "Where is X?" → Better: "How do I get to X?"
2. **Missing context**: "Best route" → Better: "Best route from [A] to [B]"
3. **Ambiguous location**: "the park" → Better: "Mont-Royal Park" or "Parc La Fontaine"

## Pro Tips

- The bot ALWAYS checks weather before suggesting bike/walk routes
- Mention if you have mobility concerns for better route suggestions
- Ask for alternatives: "What other options do I have?"
- Use landmarks: "near the orange line" or "close to the Bell Centre"
- Be specific about urgency: "fastest route" vs "route with least walking"
